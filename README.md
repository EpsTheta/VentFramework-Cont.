## *Note: This repository is the OFFICIAL continuation of Vent Framework due to the original creator passing the project.*

### **Version 1.0.0**
The first official release of VentLib/VentFramework. These features are still experimental but this release marks the turning point where I feel the framework has enough features that should be stable enough for public use. As traffic comes in and people begin using the framework I will maintain and fix all issues.
### **Features:**

- Highly robust option system aiming to replace BepIn's builtin configuration
    - Out-of-the-box integration with Among Us' game options
    - Highly configurable rendering for the game options
- Brand new localization system that emphasizes easy usability and organization
    - Translations are obtainable statically via attributes or a static method call
- Easy command manager for Among Us chat commands
    - Decorate classes with the command prefix then allow the framework to do all the heavy-lifting
- Super configurable modded handshake support
    - Configure the behavior when modded clients join (Kick, Disable RPC, do nothing)
- Modded "Find A Game" menu which shows modded lobbies with a cleaner UI
- Custom RPC attributes with cleaner developmental interface than Reactor
    - Batch interface which allows for objects to be sent across multiple packets
- Loads of new utilities
    - New data structures
        - Batch collection (for automatic sending list of objects with Batch-RPC)
        - An array of "Optional" objects highly influenced by Java Optional API
        - A whole bunch more
   - Revamped asynchronous methods for running & scheduling code asynchronously
   - Profiling utilities
